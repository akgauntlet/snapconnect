## Best Practices, Limitations & Conventions

### **Frontend & Mobile Development**

#### **React Native**

**Best Practices:**

- Use functional components with hooks over class components
- Implement proper prop validation with PropTypes or TypeScript
- Use `FlatList` for large data sets, avoid `ScrollView` with many items
- Optimize images with proper sizing and formats (WebP when possible)
- Use `React.memo()` for expensive components to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Implement proper error boundaries for crash prevention
- Use `InteractionManager.runAfterInteractions()` for non-critical operations

**Common Pitfalls:**

- Memory leaks from unremoved event listeners and timers
- Performance issues from frequent state updates during animations
- Platform-specific navigation issues if not properly tested on both iOS/Android
- Bundle size bloat from importing entire libraries instead of specific functions
- Improper handling of keyboard events causing UI layout issues

**Limitations:**

- Limited access to native APIs without custom modules

- Debugging can be more complex than web development
- Platform-specific bugs may require different implementations

**Conventions:**

- Use PascalCase for component names, camelCase for props and functions
- Organize components in folders with index.js exports
- Keep component files under 200 lines, extract logic to custom hooks
