# Phase 1: Setup - Foundation Infrastructure

**Duration**: 1-2 weeks  
**Objective**: Establish a working React Native application with core infrastructure, navigation, theming, and Firebase integration. This creates a solid foundation that functions at a basic level but isn't fully usable yet.

**Deliverable**: A running app with navigation, cyber gaming theme applied, and basic Firebase connection established.

---

## Phase Overview

This phase focuses on setting up the technical foundation for SnapConnect. By the end of this phase, you'll have a working React Native app with the cyber gaming aesthetic, basic navigation structure, and Firebase services connected. The app won't have core features yet, but the infrastructure will be solid and ready for feature development.

## Core Features & Tasks

### 1. **Project Structure & Configuration**
**Goal**: Set up the project according to the AI-first codebase rules and cyber gaming theme.

**Steps**:
1. Initialize the directory structure following `project-rules.md` specifications
2. Configure NativeWind with cyber gaming color palette and custom fonts
3. Set up path aliases for clean imports (`@/components`, `@/services`, etc.)
4. Configure Metro bundler and Babel for optimal performance
5. Create environment configuration files for development/staging/production

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Directory structure matches project-rules.md specifications
- NativeWind configured with cyber gaming colors (#0a0a0a, #00ffff, #ff00ff, etc.)
- Import aliases working correctly
- Development server runs without errors

### 2. **Firebase Integration & Configuration**
**Goal**: Connect Firebase services for authentication, database, and storage.

**Steps**:
1. Set up Firebase project with Authentication, Realtime Database, and Storage enabled
2. Configure Firebase SDK in the React Native app with environment-specific configs
3. Create Firebase service modules (`authService.js`, `firebaseService.js`)
4. Test Firebase connection with basic read/write operations
5. Set up Firebase security rules for development environment

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Firebase services connected and responding
- Environment-specific configuration working
- Basic security rules in place
- Firebase console shows connected app

### 3. **Navigation Architecture**
**Goal**: Implement the main navigation structure with cyber gaming theme.

**Steps**:
1. Set up React Navigation with bottom tab navigator and stack navigators
2. Create placeholder screens for Camera, Messages, Stories, Profile
3. Apply cyber gaming styling to navigation elements with RGB accents
4. Implement proper navigation flow between main sections
5. Add navigation animations with gaming-inspired transitions

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Bottom tab navigation working with cyber theme styling
- Smooth transitions between screens
- Navigation state properly managed
- Gaming aesthetic applied to tab bar and headers

### 4. **Theme System Implementation**
**Goal**: Implement the complete cyber gaming theme system with Orbitron fonts and RGB effects.

**Steps**:
1. Install and configure Orbitron, Inter, and JetBrains Mono fonts
2. Create theme provider with CyberTheme configuration from theme-rules.md
3. Implement base components (CyberButton, GameCard) with RGB styling
4. Set up NativeWind with custom color palette and animations
5. Test theme system across different screen sizes and devices

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Custom fonts loading correctly across platforms
- Theme provider accessible throughout app
- Base components styled with cyber gaming aesthetic
- Responsive design working on different screen sizes

### 5. **State Management Setup**
**Goal**: Configure Zustand stores for global state management.

**Steps**:
1. Set up Zustand with devtools and persistence middleware
2. Create base store structure for auth, theme, and app state
3. Implement store patterns following project-rules.md guidelines
4. Add TypeScript interfaces for store state and actions
5. Test state persistence and hydration on app restart

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Zustand stores configured with proper TypeScript types
- State persistence working correctly
- DevTools integration functional in development
- Store patterns following established conventions

## Technical Requirements

### **Dependencies Installation**
```bash
# Core React Native and Expo dependencies
npm install react-navigation-v6 zustand react-native-reanimated

# Firebase services
npm install @react-native-firebase/app @react-native-firebase/auth @react-native-firebase/database @react-native-firebase/storage

# Styling and theming
npm install nativewind tailwindcss react-native-svg

# Development tools
npm install --save-dev @types/react @types/react-native typescript eslint
```

### **Font Configuration**
- Orbitron: Weights 300, 400, 500, 700, 900
- Inter: Weights 400, 500, 600, 700
- JetBrains Mono: Weights 400, 500, 700

### **Performance Targets**
- App startup time: < 3 seconds on mid-range devices
- Navigation transitions: 60fps consistently
- Memory usage: < 150MB baseline
- Bundle size: < 25MB for initial setup

## Testing & Quality Assurance

### **Manual Testing Checklist**
- [ ] App builds and runs on both iOS and Android
- [ ] Navigation works smoothly between all main sections
- [ ] Cyber gaming theme displays correctly
- [ ] Custom fonts render properly
- [ ] Firebase connection established (check console)
- [ ] State persistence works after app restart
- [ ] No console errors or warnings
- [ ] App responds correctly to orientation changes

### **Automated Testing Setup**
- Unit tests for theme utilities and basic components
- Integration tests for navigation flow
- Firebase connection tests with mocked services

---

## Documentation Requirements

### **Files to Create/Update**
1. `src/config/firebase.js` - Firebase configuration
2. `src/config/theme.js` - Theme configuration
3. `tailwind.config.js` - NativeWind configuration
4. `src/navigation/AppNavigator.js` - Main navigation setup
5. `src/stores/themeStore.js` - Theme state management
6. `README.md` - Updated setup instructions

### **Code Documentation Standards**
- All files must include header documentation per project-rules.md
- Function documentation with JSDoc/TSDoc
- Component props and TypeScript interfaces documented
- Configuration files with inline comments explaining choices

---

## Risk Mitigation

### **Potential Issues & Solutions**
1. **Font Loading Issues**: Preload fonts and provide fallbacks
2. **Navigation Performance**: Use lazy loading for heavy screens
3. **Firebase Connection**: Implement retry logic and offline handling
4. **Theme Consistency**: Create comprehensive component testing
5. **Device Compatibility**: Test on minimum supported OS versions

### **Rollback Plan**
- Keep working branch with minimal setup
- Document all configuration changes
- Maintain environment-specific configs for easy switching

---

## Success Metrics

### **Phase 1 Complete When**:
- [ ] App runs without errors on both platforms
- [ ] All main navigation screens accessible
- [ ] Cyber gaming theme fully applied
- [ ] Firebase services connected and functional
- [ ] State management working correctly
- [ ] Performance targets met
- [ ] All documentation updated
- [ ] Team can confidently start MVP development

### **Demo Requirements**
Prepare a 5-minute demo showing:
1. App startup with cyber gaming splash screen
2. Navigation between main sections with smooth transitions
3. Theme consistency across screens
4. Firebase connection working (show console)
5. State persistence demonstration
