# Phase 2: MVP - Core Messaging Platform

**Duration**: 3-4 weeks  
**Objective**: Build a functional ephemeral messaging platform with camera capture, user authentication, friend management, and basic stories. This delivers the core value proposition of a Snapchat clone.

**Deliverable**: A working app where users can sign up, take photos/videos, send ephemeral messages to friends, and view stories.

## Phase Overview

This phase transforms the foundation into a usable messaging platform. Users can authenticate, capture content, send ephemeral messages with timers, manage friends, and share stories. By the end of this phase, SnapConnect will function as a basic but complete Snapchat clone with the cyber gaming aesthetic.

## Technical Implementation

### **Database Schema Design**
```javascript
// Firebase Realtime Database structure
{
  users: {
    userId: {
      username: "string",
      displayName: "string",
      profilePhoto: "string",
      phoneNumber: "string",
      createdAt: "timestamp",
      lastActive: "timestamp"
    }
  },
  
  messages: {
    messageId: {
      senderId: "string",
      recipientId: "string",
      mediaUrl: "string",
      mediaType: "photo|video",
      timer: "number", // seconds
      sentAt: "timestamp",
      viewedAt: "timestamp|null",
      expiresAt: "timestamp"
    }
  },
  
  friends: {
    userId: {
      friendId: "timestamp" // when friendship was established
    }
  },
  
  stories: {
    userId: {
      storyId: {
        mediaUrl: "string",
        mediaType: "photo|video",
        createdAt: "timestamp",
        expiresAt: "timestamp",
        viewers: ["userId1", "userId2"]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### **Security Rules Configuration**
```javascript
// Firebase Security Rules
{
  "rules": {
    "users": {
      "$uid": {
        ".read": "auth != null",
        ".write": "auth != null && auth.uid == $uid"
      }
    },
    "messages": {
      "$messageId": {
        ".read": "auth != null && (auth.uid == data.child('senderId').val() || auth.uid == data.child('recipientId').val())",
        ".write": "auth != null && auth.uid == data.child('senderId').val()"
      }
    },
    "friends": {
      "$uid": {
        ".read": "auth != null && auth.uid == $uid",
        ".write": "auth != null && auth.uid == $uid"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### **State Management Structure**
```javascript
// Store organization following project-rules.md
authStore.js      // User authentication and profile
messagesStore.js  // Message sending/receiving state
cameraStore.js    // Camera settings and media capture
friendsStore.js   // Friend management and discovery
